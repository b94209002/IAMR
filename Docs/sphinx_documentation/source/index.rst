Welcome to IAMR's documentation!
================================

IAMR is a parallel, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code that uses
subcycling in time and solves the variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations 
in the presence of complex geometries.
It is built on top of AMReX, a publicly available software framework designed for 
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications.

Active development in IAMR is ongoing in the development branch. 
Changes are merged into the main branch at the beginning of each month.
